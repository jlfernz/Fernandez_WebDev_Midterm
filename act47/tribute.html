    <div class="quote">
        <p>Said by a Pulitzer Prize, Grammy, Emmy, Tony Award-winning composer, lyricist, and actor, Lin-Manuel is the creator and original star of Broadway’s Hamilton and In the Heights, and the recipient of the 2015 MacArthur Foundation Award and 2018 Kennedy Center Honors.</p>

        <p>I would like to share to you how this man inspired me to become an artist and how I greatly respect him for everything that he has done.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lin-Manuel Miranda was not raised with a silver spoon in his mouth. He grew up in a Hispanic neighbourhood in northern Manhattan. His love for music was greatly influenced by childhood home that was filled with the sounds of salsa and show tunes. Lin saw his first Broadway musical, Les Misérables, (which I really love watching) at the age of seven, and it made a lasting impression on him. His tastes also ran to hip-hop and R&B, and he became a proficient rapper.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>Lin studied theatre at Wesleyan University, where he continued to perform in musicals and to write his own songs and shows. It was there that he penned the first draft of the musical In the Heights, which was set in Washington Heights, a northern Manhattan neighbourhood similar to that of his own childhood. It opened Off-Broadway in February 2007 and ran until July, with him in the lead role; it won two Drama Desk Awards. In the Heights had its Broadway debut in March 2008 and won four Tony Awards, including those for best musical and best original score. The show was also nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and its original-cast recording won the 2008 Grammy Award for best musical show album.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>After reading Ron Chernow’s 2004 biography about Alexander Hamilton, he began creating a musical about the Founding Father.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>In January 2015, my favorite musical called Hamilton opened Off-Broadway at New York City’s Public Theater, where its huge success led to an early move to Broadway in July.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>In 2016 Hamilton the Musical was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and that year it received an unprecedented 16 Tony nominations, with him earning several nods, including best actor in a leading role in a musical. The production eventually won 11 Tonys, falling one short of the record. Hamilton was named best musical, and Lin won for best book and best original score.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>The following year, Hamilton opened in London’s West End, where Rachelle An Go casted as Elizabeth Schuyler and  it was a critical and commercial success. It won seven Olivier Awards, including best new play. In addition, Lin garnered the award for outstanding achievement in music. As one of the creators of Hamilton, he received a special Kennedy Center Honor in 2018 for developing a groundbreaking work that defies category.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>Lin did not only show his love for his craft but also his compassion to other people</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>In 2019 he reprised the title role for a brief run in Puerto Rico to benefit the Flamboyan Arts Fund, a nonprofit he founded after Hurricane Maria (2017) to ensure support for the arts. He had been active in causes on behalf of Puerto Rico throughout his career.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>His passion for musical doesn't stop there.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>Lin later contributed to the soundtrack for the Disney animated film Moana (2016), and he earned an Academy Award nomination—his first—for the song “How Far I’ll Go.” In the musical Mary Poppins Returns (2018) he assumed the mantle of lamplighter and sidekick to the eponymous nanny. He co-wrote music and lyrics for Bring It On: The Musical and starred in the Encores! productions of Merrily We Roll Along and tick, tick...BOOM!. Lin then starred in the TV series His Dark Materials (2019– ), which was based on Philip Pullman’s best-selling fantasy trilogy.</li>
            <br></br>
            <li>Lin-Manuel Miranda is a genius in his craft. Everyone loves him because of his passion and work ethic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>He's the epitome of a true artist.</h4>
