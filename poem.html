        <p>
           I remember how happy our family was 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was almost perfect, I could say
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember how we spend our Fridays
        </p>
        <p>
            We dance, we play, and we’ll have our movie date
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, it was my favorite day.
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember Mama's best friend 
        </p>
        <p>
            Who’s with us always,
        </p>
        <p>
            He loves me and I loved him very much
        </p>
        <p>
            It was good, it was fun
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems like everything is perfectly fine
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            But I don't remember how that ended
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't remember how this new life started
        </p>
        <p>
            The vivid memories we shared had faded
        </p>
        <p>
            Tell me it's just a dream coz I can't believe it
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't want to believe it
        </p>
        <p>
            Our happiness has turned to sadness
        </p>
        <p>
            It was colorful but now it's black
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Friday evenings turn mourning’s
        </p>
        <p>
            Tell me, how can I bring it back?
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Dad, why can't I see you?
        </p>
        <p>
            Is it true? Tell me that it's not coz I'll believe in you.
        </p>
        <p>
            But dad I saw you.
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw mama in your room
        </p>
        <p>
            She's alone, waiting for you to come home
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember when you promised her
        </p>
        <p>
            That she'll be the only woman in your life
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, she's the only woman in your life
        </p>
        <p>
            But I can't believe you'll have an affair with a guy
        </p>
        <p>
            The guy whom I love
        </p>
        <p>
            And the guy you love was mama's best friend
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            And now
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember how you love Fridays
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember how you laugh together
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember how you make fun with each other
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember how you want to sit next to him
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember how you're comfortable with each other
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember everything
        </p>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <p>
            And I understand it now
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that you love him
        </p>
        <p>
            And I want you to be happy
        </p>
        <p>
            But dad, is it too much to ask to give me a complete family?
